# BankChurners_machine_learning_project

This repository contains files related to a machine learning project focused on predicting bank customer churn. Below is a quick summary of the key files:

1. **Dataset:**
   - File: `your_dataset_file.csv`
   - Description: This CSV file serves as the dataset for the project, containing the necessary data for training and evaluating the machine learning model.

2. **Code Implementation:**
   - File: `your_model_building_code.ipynb`
   - Description: The Jupyter Notebook file includes the code implementation of the machine learning model. It covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model training.

3. **Model for Deployment:**
   - File: `model.pkl`
   - Description: The trained machine learning model has been serialized into a pickle file (`model.pkl`), ready for deployment. This file can be used to make predictions on new data.

Feel free to explore the code, dataset, and the deployment-ready model. If you have any questions or need further information, please don't hesitate to reach out.
